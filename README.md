# ORM-Query-Lab-Project
Learning Objective:
The objective of this project is to get more comfortable using the Django ORM query methods to retrieve data from a MySQL database. Many of your future projects, including the capstone, will require you to use similar Django ORM queries that you will be introduced to here. Your proficiency will grow with each project.

Tasks:

1. Complete the required queries in each view.py function.

2. Print your query results to the terminal and attempt to match the provided “Expected Terminal Result” as shown in the comments under each function. (Also shown in the browser)

3. Utilize the Django Debug Toolbar to view the actual SQL that is executed by your ORM queries.

4. Use the web page’s navigation buttons to execute the corresponding functions
